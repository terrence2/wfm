Works For Me
============

This is a helper program for configuring SpiderMonkey.

SpiderMonkey has something like 20 different important and semi-useful
configuration flags, most of them long and hard to spell. This program
simplifies configuration for me by bundling and shortening the various flags
into easier to type names and taking them from the directory name. This saves a
bunch of typing and makes it harder to test with the wrong configuration.
